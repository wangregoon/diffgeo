\chapter{Manifolds}
A smooth manifold can be seen as a set with two layers of structure: first a toplogy,
ten a smooth structure.

\section{Topological Manifolds}

\begin{definition}[\emph{Topological Manifold}] 
Suppose $M$ is a topological space, M is a \emph{topological n-manifold} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\bullet$] $M$ is a \emph{Hausdorff space}: For every pair of points $p,q \in M$, 
there are disjoint open subsets $U,V\subset M$such that $p\in U$ and $q\in V$.
\item[$\bullet$] $M$ is \emph{second countable}: There exists a coutable basis for 
the topologyof $M$.
\item[$\bullet$] $M$ is \emph{locally Euclidean of dimension n}: Every point has a 
neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of $\R^n$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
